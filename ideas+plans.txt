THE GAME THE PLACE

A replication of r/Place that allows for users to click a square and change its color every certain amount of seconds.

===Main Features/Tasks===

--Account System--
(Users need to have an account)
Have them sign in with a discord account? (Could be a cool thing to learn, actually, could use a Discord bot to notify users about their recharge being up) -- (OPTIONALLY) DISCORD FUNCTIONALITY

--Color Grid System--
Using React to render an [N x N] grid, (where N will be decided on later, ((need to add ability for changing/modifying grid as admin command)))

--Admin Commands--
If you log in with an admin account (which is set directly through either a database or something else IDK) you have greater features that normal users don't have access to. These include:
    - No timer for adding colors
    - Wiping the board (should require confirmation/multiple clicks)
    - Modifying the board
    - Timing out certain users / seeing how contributed 


--Pixel Timeline--
Implement tracking all changes to the board every second(?)

--Whitelisting Users--
Only THE GAME, or certain THE GAME users are allowed


===Project Implementation/Technologies===

--React--
Implement the UI + Grid utilizing React for the frontend

Esesntially, a pixel object will be defined, that has a color property, an rgb value property, a position (x,y coordinates)
Optionally:
    - Keep Track of last modifying user

The, a grid row will be defined that holds an N amount of pixels
The actual grid row object will consist of an N amount of grid rows

The user will be able to select from a grid of (say 8 x 2 for now) colors, along with a color picker that takes up the size of ~[1.8 x 1.8] color squares




--Express--
Handle the server API requests for the backend

When a user logs in
    - Store their credentials (encrypt password) 
    If discord:
    - IDK (look this up later)
    - Probably just storing the discord username and thats it?

When a pixel is clicked
    - Use the selected color, and change the pixel's rgb to said color
    - Send a request to the server about said pixel's rgb+lastUser (Using the coordinates)
    - Update the users' timer internally (to not allow for refreshes) [NOTE: this functionality MIGHT be able to be implemented with localBrowser Storage rather than a whole server, IDK]

--MongoDB, or SQL--
Decision for database will be made later
Using Mongo is more familiar, but SQL is something I need to learn
